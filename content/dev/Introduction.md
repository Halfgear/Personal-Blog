## My Experience with Riot Games

For the past 10 years, Riot Games has been the cornerstone of my gaming experience. I've always cherished those competitive moments, playing alongside friends to clutch those hard-earned victories in League of Legends and Valorant or watching last year DRX’s amazing world winning story. My enthusiasm was so contagious that I naturally wanted more friends to join the fray. Yet, the highly competitive nature of these games made it challenging for me as an advanced player to guide them. I often found it tough to step into their shoes, to see what they were seeing and understand what they didn't yet know.


### What Should We Do Then?

Last year, Mahjong, though considered unfamiliar board game in Korea, surged in popularity on Korean Twitch streams because of a mobile game. Around then, a small website began to gain traction in twitch chat with the tagline, "Watch this, and you're set to play Mahjong with anyone!" Veteran players found it invaluable, frequently sharing it with newcomers before they start playing together. This sparked an idea in me: What if there existed a similar platform for games like League or Valorant? Such a tool could be the perfect way to convince my friends into my favorite games! Imagine the convenience for beginners, enabling the player group to quick intergration into matches alongside their more experienced friends.

Building on that thought, I’m developing a Valorant website as backend developer and product manager for my internship. Yes, there are numerous Valorant sites like tracker.gg that simply display past match histories and compute basic stats, such as headshot rates like the image above. But I wanted to show insights beyond that.


I want our website to be a starting point for beginners – a place where they can dive into curated content, gain the confidence to play alongside their friends, and understand their baisc in-game roles. Furthermore, I want to offer more than just the basics; I aim to provide insights into the game's environment and share intriguing facts. I'll be sharing into some of these captivating stats in this post.

### Wrapping Up the Insights
Throughout my journey from a beginner Sage player to an intermediate at the Platinum rank in Valorant, many insights gradually formed in my mind. While I've shared a few of these findings here, trust me, the rabbit hole goes much deeper. I've rigorously investigated almost every piece of data output from Valorant's match API to answer my curiosity about the Valorant statistics.

However, due to my contractual obligations with the company, there's a plethora of information I need to withhold – at least for now. That said, these insights will be instrumental in shaping the website we're currently developing, ensuring it becomes a rich resource for both newbies and veterans. I am very excited to bring these insights into the website!


## Conclusion

As a gamer and e-sports fan, I've experienced firsthand the thrill, strategy, and camaraderie games can bring. I genuinely hope more people come to appreciate and enjoy what games can offer.

In line with this passion, I have been harnessing my backend development skills to support the website development of my current internship and create a platform to bridge the huge gap between newbies and seasoned players. As next step, I will apply for a Riot 2024 summer internship to immerse myself further into a community and company I want to join to learn! But regardless of the outcome, my commitment will remain unchanged. Even if I don't secure a spot at Riot, my ambition is to persist in the gaming industry, especially in backend development roles, drawing from the experiences of my current internship.
