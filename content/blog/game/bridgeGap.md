## Barrier to learn
![me](/posts/League/barrier.png)

For those new to the realm of Riot game, stepping into a universe that has evolved over 13 years can be incredibly overwhelming. With League boasting over 200 items, 164 champions, and each champion possessing at least five distinct abilities, the volume of the raw information to grasp is staggering. Presenting a beginner with these numbers is a easy way to trigger a sense of awe, and perhaps, intimidation.

### Don’t want to make it easy

One of the intrinsic appeals of gaming is the sensation of overcoming the stress and challenges presented to the player. The greater the challege that players overcome is the more profound the sense of satisfaction. Both League of Legends and Valorant offer intense levels of competition, leading sometimes to conflicts between randomly matched teammates in their first normal queue against people. Many players feel overwhelmed during their very first match and choose to avoid playing League rest of their life after the horrible experience. 


### Wrapping Up the Insights
Throughout my journey from a beginner Sage player to an intermediate at the Platinum rank in Valorant, many insights gradually formed in my mind. While I've shared a few of these findings here, trust me, the rabbit hole goes much deeper. I've rigorously investigated almost every piece of data output from Valorant's match API to answer my curiosity about the Valorant statistics.

However, due to my contractual obligations with the company, there's a plethora of information I need to withhold – at least for now. That said, these insights will be instrumental in shaping the website we're currently developing, ensuring it becomes a rich resource for both newbies and veterans. I am very excited to bring these insights into the website!
