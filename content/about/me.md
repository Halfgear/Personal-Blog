Hello everyone! Thank you for visiting my website,

As a computer science student, I have a true passion for technology and gaming. I switched my major from chemistry to computer science in my third year of university and it has been one of the best decisions I've ever made. Although I may have started my journey a little later than some of my peers, I've been learning and discovering all the amazing things this field has to offer.

When it comes to gaming, I have a special interest in team-based games and RPGs. I enjoy analyzing what makes games like League of Legends, Valorant, Lost Ark, and many others so fun and engaging. I believe that by truly understanding the underlying mechanics and systems of these games, I can improve my own skills and share my insights with the gaming development community.

My goal for this website is to share my journey and connect with others who share my passions. I'm excited to share my journey and connect with like-minded individuals. I'm looking forward to getting to know you all. 

HwiJoon Lee
