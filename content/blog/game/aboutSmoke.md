- Objective:
Explore if expected Agent difficulty reflects in win rate stats like it does in League of Legend.
- Dataset Overview: 
Using the Python and MongoDB, I wanted to calculate the agent’s win rate difference between high and low tier. I will provide the provide my insight into the obtained data about the agent’s performance gap between high and low tier.

This chart reveals that around 8% of rounds lacked a smoke agent (Controller) within a team composition. However, for games played at the platinum tier or above, this number shrunk to 3.24%. This suggests that higher-tier players prioritize having at least one controller in their lineup. If we could widely share these insights, it might alleviate the undue pressure players feel about team compositions. In turn, this could greatly enhance the gaming experience, especially when paired with random teammates.
