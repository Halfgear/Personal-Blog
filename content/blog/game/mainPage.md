## Understanding Valorant

Valorant's unique appeal is rooted in its foundational design philosophy that promotes a layered gaming experience. Players are incentivized when they successfully gather information, strategize their moves, and execute these strategies. This progression is termed the "tactical cycle," and following it often leads to victories. The developers have thoughtfully crafted both maps and agents to further reinforce this cycle.

Each agent possesses distinct strengths and vulnerabilities that can deeply influence gameplay. To amplify this dynamic, maps are designed to either bolster or counteract an agent's abilities. For example, some maps might cater to agents that are adept at obtaining critical information, while others might be tailored for executing planned strategies.

Consider the map "Bind", characterized by its teleports and narrow rooms with short corners. This map design gives an benefits to Raze over Jett. Her grenades and drones are perfect tools to scout these corners, ensuring safety for her as she enters sites. Conversely, while Jett lacks abilities tailored for corner scouting in Bind, her agility can outperform Raze in different maps. Her swift movements and dashes provide her with an advantage that emphasize quick maneuvers and agile gameplay.

Learning Valorant is more than just mastering agent abilities or perfecting combat mechanics. Knowing which agent fits better to play in each map will significantly benefit players. It's about recognizing the intricate interplay between agents, maps, and team strategies. Each map, with unique architecture of Valorant, naturally complements certain agents while challenging others. This depth is what beginners need to understand.

## What should we do for users?

This is where our website's main page feature becomes invaluable. By guiding players on which agents fare best on specific maps, we're essentially equipping them with a game plan even before the match begins They no longer approach a game blindfolded, but with a strategic framework informed by data-driven insights from our platform.

 Furthermore, users will gain access to comprehensive defense and attack win rates for each map. This data dives deep into the nuances of map design, revealing patterns and strategies that might not be evident at first glance.

Thus, our website doesn't just offer information; it offers a foundation upon which players can build their in-game strategies intuitively. And as they grow more familiar with these agent-map dynamics, they naturally begin to experiment, adapt, and eventually master the tactical depth that Valorant offers.

## Conclusion

Understanding the nuanced intricacies of Valorant – the delicate balance between agents, maps, and strategies – was the catalyst behind the idea of our main page feature, focusing on map-related agent tiers. Thanks to the remarkable efforts of our skilled design team members, we were able to visualize this concept into a tangible design that users can interact with. My next task is to research match data deeper using Python and structure a robust backend system to support the front end. Together, our collective efforts aim to empower Valorant players to elevate their gaming experience, strategize effectively, and immerse themselves fully into the tactical depth the game offers.
