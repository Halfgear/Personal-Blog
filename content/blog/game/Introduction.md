## My Experience with Riot

For the past 10 years, Riot Games has been the cornerstone of my gaming experience. I've always cherished those competitive moments, playing alongside friends to clutch those hard-earned victories in League of Legends and Valorant.

My enthusiasm was so contagious that I naturally wanted more friends to join the lobby. Yet, the highly competitive nature of these games made it challenging for me as an advanced player to guide them. I often found it tough to step into their shoes, to see what they were seeing and understand what they didn't yet know.

### How this project started

While watching steamers from Youtube and Twitch, I often observed experienced players referencing tutorial websites for board games as they mentored newcomers. This practical approach allowed to east the learning curve and fostered better in-game synergy between old and new players. It made me wonder: What if there was a similar platform for  Valorant? Such a tool would ensure a smoother integration into matches, even when paired with seasoned players.

As I do further research about the tool, I encountered numerous Valorant sites like tracker.gg. These sites simply showcased past match histories and basic stats such as headshot rates. However, many of these platforms were geared towards intermediate to hardcore players looking to enhance their skill. A glaring gap existed for beginners, and I aimed to fill it by offering insights that extended beyond mere statistics and genuinely catered to newcomers, guiding them through their new journey into the game.

Building on the inspiration, I needed the right developers and team to bring my vision to real life. I reached out to a company I had previously collaborated with on a [***side project***](https://jooncode.com/code/nestdiscordbot/) during semester. They operated a League match history website called lol.ps and had established a reputation for data analysis and aimed at enriching every gamer's experience. Given their expertise and shared ethos, I felt they were the perfect partners to help realize my idea. Consequently, I began my internship with them, diving deep into roles as a backend developer and product manager.

## Conclusion

As a gamer and e-sports fan, I've experienced firsthand the thrill, strategy, and camaraderie games can bring. I genuinely hope more people come to appreciate and enjoy what games can offer.

Driven by the passion, I refine my backend development skills to enhance the website development at my current internship. Our primary goal is to design a platform that serves as a bridge, seamlessly connecting newcomers with the seasoned players, fostering understanding and shared joy.

With commitment and the collective efforts of our team, we aim to launch the service by this coming December. Through this platform, we aspire to simplify the learning curve and amplify the enjoyment for everyone who steps into Valorant.
