In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll outline our current implementations and the ongoing developments for our backend system design.
Pipeline with Kafka In our quest to build an advanced and reliable infrastructure, Kafka became a cornerstone of our design. The integration effectively separates our crawler from our statistical calculation components, aiming for a system that remains robust, especially when it faces potential computational challenges.</description></item><item><title>Building a Match Crawler</title><link>https://jooncode.com/blog/code/crawler/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jooncode.com/blog/code/crawler/</guid><description>Before I check my insights of Valorant with stats, the foremost task was to construct a robust data crawler. This pivotal first step would act as the foundation, paving the way for any meaningful analysis. When building a data crawler to fetch, process, and store a massive amount of data, challenges are inevitable. As I embarked on my journey to create a crawler for Valorant&amp;rsquo;s match data, I encountered a series of obstacles that pushed me to optimize my approach in terms of speed, storage, and robustness.</description></item><item><title>Agent difficulty Paradox</title><link>https://jooncode.com/blog/game/agentparadox/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jooncode.com/blog/game/agentparadox/</guid><description>Introduction The realm of Valorant offers players numerous agents, each boasting unique abilities and strategies to win. But how do players, both new and experienced, navigate this vast selection?
With a combination of Python programming and a rich dataset extracted from MongoDB, I obtained the performance metrics of various agents across different skill tiers. The result challenges widely held beliefs and shed light on the actual efficacy of agents in various gameplay scenarios.</description></item></channel></rss>
