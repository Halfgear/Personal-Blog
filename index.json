[{"content":"\u003ch2 id=\"what-if-there-is-faker-bot-in-league\"\u003eWhat if there is Faker Bot in League?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a computer science student, I find artificial intelligence (AI) bots fascinating. I want to extend the AI idea within the context of popular video games. With the development of AI technology, the way we play video games has drastically changed. AI-powered video games are now more interactive and immersive than ever before and have opened up a world of possibilities for gamers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAI technology is also being used to create computer-controlled opponents that are smarter and learn from their mistakes, making the game much more challenging and fun. Moreover, AI-driven games can generate unique and customizable environments for players to explore and enjoy. These AI-driven environments can give rise to the development of new meta, creating new and exciting ways to play these games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of an AI playing League of Legends at the highest level is an inspiring one. In order for it to play at a top level, it would need a massive amount of data from pro games and solo ranks with knowledge to be able to accurately react to in-game events in real-time. This would include its ability to understand every lane, item and champion interaction, as well as understanding the meta at a certain point in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/posts/League/humanVSai.jpg\" alt=\"Image from Sejong University\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an simlar attempt to create a \u0026ldquo;Pro Gamer AI\u0026rdquo; in Starcraft in 2017 at Sejong University, but it was not successful at the time because they were not able to build machine learning structure for the real time simulation games. For an AI to play at a top level, it would need to understand a massive amount of data from pro games and solo ranks, as well as knowledge to be able to accurately react to in-game events in real-time. This would include its ability to understand every lane, item and champion interaction, as well as understanding the meta at a certain point in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is fascinating to think about how this AI would be played. Would it still be EU meta, or would there be outstanding champions according to AI? Its ability to react to in-game events could make it an even more exciting player to watch. Additionally, an AI playing LOL at an AlphaGo level could potentially revolutionize the game with new meta led by AI and provide new insights for pro league games win percentage according to current situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/posts/League/LOL_Crowd.jpg\" alt=\"League Crowd\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe potential for AI technology in League of Legends is truly remarkable. As we imagine the possibilities, it\u0026rsquo;s clear that this technology has the power to transform the game in exciting new ways. The AI-led meta could open up entirely new strategies and tactics, and provide deep insights into the performance of professional teams and their win percentages in real-time. Furthermore, it has the potential to revolutionize the way intermediate-level players practice and improve their skills. By offering a challenging, dynamic and ever-changing AI opponent, players will no longer have to rely on boring or repetitive normal AI matches to sharpen their abilities. The future of League of Legends and AI technology is truly exciting. As I learn more about league API data and AI, I want to develop AI model for the pro league strategies!\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"Thoughts about AI as a player in League of Legend","image":"/posts/League/faker.jpeg","permalink":"https://jooncode.com/blogs/game/leagueaibot/","title":"AI League of Legend"}]
