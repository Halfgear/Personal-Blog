## Introduction 
Software engineering is a rapidly changing field. Every day, new tools and technologies are being released that can help developers more efficiently create and manage applications. As a software engineer, it can be difficult to keep up with all the changes and ensure that you are staying up to date with the latest best practices. In this blog post, I will share my experience reaching out to my [favorite league data analysis youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqI5lyTpC79pOy2D-VXAMdA)'s company and apply my knowlege and skill out side of class.

## How I reached out to them
After completing the basic Computer Science classes, I looked for interesting side projects to join. I sent an e-mail to one of my favorite League YouTuber expressing my interest to join any proejcts and my desire to collaborate. To my surprise, the CEO responded and suggested that I start by helping with management of Discord community called NoTrollz for league of legend friendly matchs between clubs first. Then see if we could further develop something once we got to know each other better. I was thrilled to have the opportunity to work with a real-world company and acquire some valuable experience.

## Working on the Project
My recent project was to create a discord bot that manages user's roles and teams. The goal of the project was to learn Typescript and NestJs that would make the bot to be accessible to company's current work environment. One of the biggest challenges I faced was learning how to learning new language and framework with limited amount of documents. These tools are relatively new and I had no prior experience working with them. Despite the challenges, I was ultimately able to create a simple bot that automated the chore for the server manager.

## Continuing Education 
After the first part, I had a meeting with a senior developer from the company I'm working with. During the meeting, we discussed the current feature and the senior developer suggested to create a user data base and develop a more advanced automation bot. 

The automation of the feature could not be done solely with Discord's features and a database was necessary to handle user's roles and teams for extendability and sustainability. To match the company's existing system, I am learning to use Docker Compose and PostgreSQL. To ensure my plan of action would work, I conducted research and experimented with the new technologies before implementing them into the project.

## Conclusion
Overall, my experience working on this project was very rewarding. In a short amount of time, I was able to apply my knowledge of Object Oriented Design and acquire new experiences. Continuous education is an important part of staying up to date in the ever-changing world of software engineering and this project gave me the great lesson. By researching and experimenting with the latest tools and technologies, I am looking forward to create an advanced bot that improved the workflow of the community management of the company.
