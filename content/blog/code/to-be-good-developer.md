# Introduction
- Briefly introduce the changing landscape of the software development world.
- Mention how AI tools like GitHub Copilot and language models like ChatGPT are reshaping how we code.

# The Evolution of Developer Tools
- Discuss the evolution of tools that assist coding, like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT.
- Share how these tools are accelerating the development process and improving code quality.

## Why Just Coding Isn't Enough
- Introduce the idea that a developer who only writes assigned code will soon find themselves redundant, especially as AI tools continue to improve.
- **Why I Chose Human-Centered Computing as My CS Major Concentration**
  - Discuss your belief that AI could eventually replace sophisticated coding tasks.
  - Highlight the rapidly evolving tech landscape and the growing need for user-friendly guides to help people adapt.
  - Advocate that Human-Centered Computing is becoming increasingly important in making technology more accessible and understandable to new users or clients.

# The Three Pillars of a Good Developer

## 1. Understanding the Problem
- Elaborate on the importance of knowing what the client needs and understanding their pain points.
- Discuss the value of empathy and good communication skills in understanding a client's problem.
- picking appropriate tool to acheive the goal appropriately. (No overkill in time, cost, resourse wise)

## 2. Problem-Solving
- Emphasize that a good developer should be able to come up with creative and effective solutions, not just in terms of code but also in other aspects like user experience.
- Give examples like the "mirror in the elevator" to illustrate how problem-solving isn't limited to coding.
- Creating good business value. (knowing what is the priority for the company. What is the product trying to reslove. What is the unique property of the client of our product?)

## 3. A Strong Desire to Learn
- Discuss the ever-changing landscape of technology and why continuous learning is essential.
- Point out the wealth of resources available online and the importance of being open to learning new tools and stacks.
- know when to seek help (TO do this, need to know context of the problem. like what is causing the problem? what did you try? what is the potential solution you thought about?)

# Conclusion
- Summarize the key points: understanding the problem, problem-solving abilities, and a strong desire to learn.
- Reiterate why these traits will make one a valuable developer in an evolving landscape that includes more and more AI tools.

# Additional Tips or Resources
- List some platforms or tools that can help a developer improve in these three areas.
  - **Also list resources that specifically focus on Human-Centered Computing to help people better understand technology.**
